## Introduction

### [Differences in impact](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/x3KXkiAQ6NH8WLbkW/p/eNwfbeZmzaHnmAaAj)

Key concepts from this session include:

- **Differences in impact:** It appears that some of our options to help do many times more good than others. People generally don’t appreciate this, and so miss out on significant opportunities to help.
- **The importance, neglectedness, tractability framework:** The most important problems generally affect a lot of people (*importance* or *scale*), are relatively under-invested in (*neglectedness*), and can be meaningfully improved with a reasonable amount of work (*tractability*).
- **Thinking on the margin:** If you're donating \$1, you should give that extra \$1 to the intervention that can most cost-effectively improve the world. There are many great initiatives with a very high average impact per dollar that will have a low marginal impact because they can't get the same efficiency at scale (they display "diminishing marginal returns").
- **Fermi estimates:** When you’re trying to make a decision, it can be useful to make a rough calculation for which option is best. Even if there’s a lot of uncertainty, this can give you a rough answer, and can tell you which things are most important to estimate next.

<u>When you think of impact what matters more?</u>

1.  Affecting a larger number of people 
   1. You could help a lot of people but in a small way e.g. make them happier by giving them a nice meal for a day

2. Affecting the same number of people in a bigger way
   1. Or you could help a smaller number of people in a more significant way e.g. pay for the education of a group of individuals
