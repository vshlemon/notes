## Introduction

### [Radical empathy](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/7pDe4y3KtwwyF6kTS)

> > *“The question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?”* 
>
> – Jeremy Bentham (1789)

> During this chapter we explore who our moral consideration should include. We focus especially on farmed animals as an important example of this question this week.
>
> Key concepts from this chapter include:
>
> - **Impartiality:** helping those that need it the most (only discounting people according to location, time, and species if those factors are in fact morally relevant).
> - **The importance (and difficulty) of considering unusual ideas:** Society’s consensus has been wrong about many things over history (e.g. the sun circling the Earth, the morality of slavery). In order to avoid making similar mistakes, we need to be open to considering unusual ideas and moral positions, while still thinking critically about the issues and acting cooperatively with others.

## Impartiality and radical empathy

### [Radical empathy](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/ehZK259et52Xnvw5F)

> "Radical" is intended as the opposite of "traditional" or "conventional."
>
> "Empathy" is intended to capture the idea that one could imagine oneself in another's position, and recognizes the other as having experiences that are worthy of consideration.

> **Who deserves empathy and moral concern?**

### [Moral progress and "Cause X"](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9K8Yiv9Fdm7XNsmCm/moral-progress-and-cause-x)

> Claim: Effective Altruism is to the pursuit of the good as the Scientific Revolution was to the pursuit of progress.

> Effective altruism is not utilitarianism. It's a much broader church than that. It allows for many diverse views about what makes someone's life go well. It doesn't have to be just happiness. And also about many other things mattering as well, such as equality between people or rights or many other aspects about morality. The main similarity, as I see them, between this utilitarian movement and the effective altruism movement is that there was a focus on going out and helping others, not just on keeping your hands clean and not doing any wrong. It was about actively going out and doing good. There was also a real focus on scale. If something was 10 or 100 times bigger, they really took that seriously and made it of central importance. And involved being willing to question the status quo. 

### [The possibility of an ongoing moral catastrophe (summary)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/Dtr8aHqCQSDhyueFZ)

> 1. There are many different kinds of ways that society could be wrong.
>    1. We could be wrong about *who* has moral standing.(eg. fetuses, animals)
>    2. We could be *empirically* wrong about what harms or hurts people who morally matter (eg. religious indoctrination of children)
>    3. We could be right about some obligations but not others.
>       1. We can act immorally in paying too much attention and using resources on false moral obligations (a la crusaders)
>    4. We could be right about what’s wrong and should be fixed, but wrong at how to *prioritize* different fixes.
>    5. We could be right about what’s wrong, but wrong about what is and is not our *responsibility* to fix. (eg. poverty, borders)
>    6. We could be wrong about the far future (natalism, existential risk)

### [On "fringe" ideas](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/hRJueS96CMLajeF57)

## The case for caring about animal welfare

### [All animals are equal](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/AXkbKxw2znzRcDEcS)

> It may be objected that comparisons of the sufferings of different species are impossible to make and that for this reason when the interests of animals and humans clash the principle of equality gives no guidance. It is probably true that comparisons of suffering between members of different species cannot be made precisely, but precision is not essential. Even if we were to prevent the infliction of suffering on animals only when it is quite certain that the interests of humans will not be affected to anything like the extent that animals are affected, we would be forced to make radical changes in our treatment of animals that would involve our diet, the farming methods we use, experimental procedures in many fields of science, our approach to wildlife and to hunting, trapping and the wearing of furs, and areas of entertainment like circuses, rodeos, and zoos. As a result, a vast amount of suffering would be avoided.

### [Animal welfare cause report, founders pledge](https://www.founderspledge.com/research/animal-welfare-cause-report)

> At least 75 billion farmed land animals and more than a trillion fish are slaughtered for food each year. Most of these animals live in highly uncomfortable environments or are killed using methods that seem very painful. Even if one thinks that the life of an average farm animal is much less important or morally relevant than the life of a human, the number of animals involved and the degree of hardship they seem to experience make intensive animal farming a major source of suffering in the world.

# Exercise

> **A letter to the past (10 mins.)** 
>
> This exercise asks you to explore what it would take to change your mind about something important.
>
> Imagine someone from the past who held views characteristic of that time. Also imagine, for the sake of the exercise, that this person is not too different from you - perhaps you would have been friends. Unfortunately, many people in the past were complicit in horrible things, such as slavery, sexism, racism, and homophobia, which were even more prevalent in the past than they are now. And, sadly, this historical counterpart is also complicit in some moral tragedy common to their time, perhaps not out of malevolence or ill-will, but merely through indifference or ignorance. 
>
> This exercise is to write a short letter to this historical friend arguing that they should care about a specific group that your present self values. Imagine that they are complicit in owning slaves, or in the oppression of women, people of other races, or sexual minorities.
>
> For the sake of this exercise, imagine your historical counterpart is not malevolent or selfish, they think they are living a normal moral life, but are unaware of where they are going wrong. What could you say to them to make them realize that they’re doing wrong? What evidence are they overlooking that allows them to hold their discriminatory views? You might want to write a few paragraphs or just bullet points, and spend time reflecting on what you write.

*My approach:*

- What if you were that person? How would you feel were the same treatment to be offered to you?
- Try to help them imagine what it would be like to be that person. 
  - Finding common ground in their experience to help them understand how the situation might feel like for them if they were the other. 
    - For e.g. if it is abuse of another then ask them if they remembered a time they had had some form of abuse, and what it felt like, then try to help them how it might impact the other.
    - Or if it is supporting political, social or legal mores that subjugate a group, ask them to imagine what if they had their fortune taken away and would face the same conditions.
- Hypothesise with them as to what treatment they would want to be the case for individuals on earth, when they do not know which identity of individual they will belong to.
  - For e.g. if the earth consisted of red and blue triangles what treatment, in an equivalent, situation would they want to see for each if they had no idea which group they would be born into, or are already of.
- Reasoning from a value that they already hold to present how their current attitude is not in line with that or is a hindrance to it etc.
